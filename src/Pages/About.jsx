            How I Came to Write This Story

            From June 28, 1970, to December 29, 1971, I served as the Public
            Information Office (PIO) clerk for the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry
            (the "2/6") Regiment of the Berlin Brigade, U.S. Army Berlin (USAB)
            in Berlin, Germany. My primary duty was to promote the 2/6 by
            getting vignettes, feature articles, and photos of Battalion
            accomplishments published in the Brigade's weekly newspaper, the
            Berlin Observer.

            In February 2020, I discovered an online archive of over 900
            complete editions of the Observer preserving Brigade-related events
            (many of significant historical importance) from the first issue on
            September 25, 1945 (just five and a half months after Germany
            surrendered) through the final publication on July 15, 1994. (See
            the Berlin Observer Archives page to access all PDFs).

            My wife suggested that I preserve my work contained in that archive
            along with some context so that my family, particularly my sons and
            grandchildren, would know a little of what my life in the Army was
            like. This website is the result of that effort. (For a description
            of how and why I started this project. Go to the page).
