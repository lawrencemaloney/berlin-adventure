          On Monday, February 2, 1970, I was one of about 40 young men inducted
          into the U. S. Army at the Induction Center in Hackensack, NJ. After
          receiving physical exams, we were lined up randomly when the military
          person in charge (probably a sergeant) asked for volunteers for the
          Marine Corps. Not getting as many as he needed, he "volunteered" a
          couple. The rest of us were loaded onto a bus and driven about 80
          miles to Fort Dix.

          We arrived after dark and were directed into a building where we were
          given uniforms and other items needed for basic training. I guess we
          must have been fed, although I don't remember it. I do remember being
          roused out of bed early the next morning while it was still dark. I
          got up right away but some who didn't were not so gently reminded that
          they were definitely "in the Army now"!

          On one of the first days in camp, we all lined up for the dreaded
          first army haircut. This was the early 70's and many of the guys had
          been cultivating long hair for a few years. The barbers (if they were
          barbers) showed no mercy. Some guys took it pretty hard. Keep in mind,
          about 25% of the trainees were draftees and had not chosen to be
          there, but they hadn’t shirked their responsibility either.

          Later in the first week, we were given aptitude tests to help the Army
          determine how our skills could best fit their needs. While this sounds
          good in theory, in times of war like this, what the Army mostly needed
          was soldiers to shoot and be shot at and this required a very limited
          set of skills. But they also needed junior officers to fill the ranks
          of those that were leaving the Amy and could not be adequately filled
          by commissioning programs like military academies. To fill the gap,
          the U.S. Army instituted Officer Candidate School (OCS). “OCS is a
          12-week course designed to train, assess, evaluate, and develop second
          lieutenants for the U.S. Army. It is the only commissioning source
          that can be responsive to the U.S. Army's changing personnel
          requirements due to its short length, compared to other commissioning
          programs and their requirements.”

          As a direct result of scores on the tests, I was among 3 or 4 out of
          two hundred or so recruits to be offered the opportunity to attend
          OCS. To be eligible I would have to agree to add one year to my
          two-year enlistment to cover the time I would spend in additional
          training. I would begin OCS After basic and advanced infantry training
          when I would be assigned to an OCS that specialized in whatever skills
          the Army thought most useful. Since it would delay a possible
          assignment to Vietnam by a couple of months and I would make a few
          more dollars each month, I signed up. The ramifications of this
          decision would not be known until I was more than half-way through my
          Advanced Infantry Training.

          At Ft. Dix, training began early every morning with a 5-mile march in
          full gear before breakfast in the mess hall. We were happy to get to
          the mess hall, but only had about 15 minutes to eat and form up for
          the day's training. We also had to quick-time march to every class.

          Some classes, like learning how to disassemble and reassemble weapons
          (we were issued M1 carbines even though the M16 was already being used
          in Vietnam) were held in classrooms but most were held in the field.
          The number one objective of Basic Training was to get us in “fighting
          shape”.

          We were engaged in some form of physical and weapons training every
          day. Physical training included calisthenics, hand-to-hand fighting,
          obstacle courses, and lots of running. We spent a fair amount of time
          on the rifle range and had to qualify with the M1 and then the M16
          before graduation. We also had to qualify with the .45 Cal pistol
          (official designation: Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1). A
          very awkward and inaccurate weapon, at least in my hands.

          After graduating from Basic Training, I was assigned to Fort Lewis
          situated just south of Tacoma, WA. (See Fort Lewis 1966-1972). It had
          a rugged terrain with a great view of Mt. Rainier. The barracks were
          old wooden buildings with metal frame bunk beds lined up on either
          side of a central aisle. I was assigned to a mortar platoon for
          specialized training in the 81mm and M30 (4.2-inch) mortars. To use
          these weapons, you had to be pretty close to the enemy. The effective
          range of both mortars was about 3 miles. Although 3 miles may seem
          like a long way, someone, a forward observer (FO), had to be close
          enough to see the enemy, radio back to the men servicing the weapon,
          and call in rounds. Calling in rounds required the FO to estimate
          distance and direction for the first round, extrapolate from where the
          round landed what adjustments need to be made for the second round.
          Watch that round, adjust again, etc.

          This was a perilous job since the enemy could sometimes establish the
          FO’s position by triangulating on his hand radio signal. All of the
          members of the mortar platoon were trained in all aspects of the
          weapon. We took pride in being able to hit a target in three rounds or
          less. Having been designated for training in mortars, it was
          understood that I would be using those skills in Vietnam.

          While my training was focused on mortars, we still spent a good
          portion of our time in physical training, pushups, obstacle courses,
          long marches in full packs, and hand-to-hand combat. Since the purpose
          of all our training was to prepare us for fighting in Vietnam, we were
          also taught skills that would be of particular value in jungle
          fighting, like recognizing booby traps and potential ambushes. We
          played “war games” that attempted to simulate what it might be like on
          patrol in Vietnam.

          I remember vividly the night-time “live fire” exercise where our
          platoon had to crawl 50 yards with full packs and a rifle while a .50
          caliber machine gun fired live rounds over our heads. Live tracer
          rounds were included so that we could see (and hear) the bullets
          flying overhead. While the exercise was spectacular, it was also a
          little scary, even though If you looked down the line instead of
          straight up, you could tell that the rounds were at least 20 – 30 feet
          above our heads, but our sergeant's admonition to “keep your head
          down” was deeply ingrained.

          We continued more traditional combat training like improving our
          marksmanship with M16s and throwing hand grenades. An interesting
          story about learning to throw hand grenades. It turns out that some
          soldiers, having practiced with dummy grenades, still couldn’t get the
          three basic steps right when it came to live fire. The live-fire
          grenade range consisted of a long row of small bunkers each about 6
          foot by 12 foot, surrounded on three sides with sandbags and
          reinforced with telephone pole sized logs. Each trainee would go
          inside the bunker with a drill sergeant. Over and over we practiced:
          1- remove the pin, 2- throw the grenade as far as you can, 3 – duck
          below the front wall.

          While I was on the firing line waiting for my turn, I heard “Fire in
          the hole!” followed closely by the body of a trainee flying out of the
          bunker, followed by the drill sergeant scrambling out, followed by an
          explosion. The drill sergeant was not happy! Apparently, the trainee
          panicked and got the order wrong. He pulled the pin, ducked, and then
          threw the grenade (1,3,2), which hit the front wall of the bunker. The
          trainee flew out of the bunker having been thrown out by the DI (a
          very strong man). Luckily, the Army is somewhat prepared for this
          level of incompetence. Each bunker had a deep trough angled so that
          grenades that didn’t make it out of the bunker over the top would
          (hopefully) role down the trough into a special compartment. No one
          was hurt, except maybe the trainee when he landed. But it solidified
          in my mind that war is dangerous and some people should not be allowed
          to fight in them.

          Approximately half-way through AIT, I developed pleurisy, an
          inflammation of the layer of tissue between the lungs and the chest
          wall. It was fairly painful and I was removed from training and placed
          on light duty, which, for me, meant Kitchen Patrol (KP). I was
          fortunate in that the chief cook in our company was a very reasonable
          person and a great cook. He had been the cook at the base commander’s
          previous post and developed a reputation as being one of the best
          cooks in the Army. When the commander moved to Ft. Lewis, the cook
          came with him. One of the things that I learned during this time was
          that officers ate a lot better than regular troops. I also learned how
          to peel potatoes fast. I took it as a challenge to peel as many as I
          could in the time allotted. I figured that since I had to peel them I
          might as well be the best at it. It turns out that this attitude was
          unusual in the Army and the cook took a liking to me. Although I
          didn’t sit with the officers, I was allowed to eat what they were
          having before helping to serve the troops.

          About two weeks earlier I had been summoned to the Headquarters
          building and directed to a small conference room. There were two other
          trainees already there. We didn’t know each other since we were from
          different training platoons. Eventually, a Major came in and
          introduced himself and explained why we there. He said that the war in
          Vietnam was winding down and that the Army was looking to close most
          of the Officer Candidate Schools to cut the cost of the war. The Army
          believed that it had more than enough officers. The issue for the Army
          was that the documents we (the soldiers) signed to be able to attend
          OCS also obligated the Army to honor their side of the contract.
          Unless both sides agreed to change the terms the Army had to send us
          to OCS. To encourage us to sign a waiver, the Army offered two
          enticements: the first was that we would revert to a 2-year active
          duty commitment and the second was that we would be guaranteed a
          choice of duty station at an Army base anywhere in the world for 12
          months. The rules regarding assignment to combat theatres at that time
          required the soldier to have more than a year of active duty time
          left.

          Putting the math skills that I had learned in school to practical use,
          I quickly (I mean really quickly!) determined that by the time I
          finished four months of training and then 12 months assigned to a base
          outside of Vietnam, I would not have enough active duty time left to
          be sent to a combat zone. To be certain, I asked the Major if that
          meant we would not be assigned to Vietnam and he said: “That is
          correct”. He told us that we had a week to decide. I did not need two
          minutes to decide. I was ready to sign. On the waiver form, we had to
          list three desired duty station locations in order of preference.
          Since I had always wanted to travel to Europe, I listed England,
          Germany, and the U.S. in that order. Reviewing the form, the Major
          said that England was very unlikely since there were “about 500 U.S.
          Army personnel in all of England!” Germany, on the other hand, seemed
          very likely to him.

          In 1970, 40% of US Army recruits were sent to Vietnam. <br />I was
          sent to Berlin!

          Back to the scene at the parade ground after graduation. As the names
          were called and the orders were handed out, my joy over reading that I
          was to report to Armry Headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany was greatly
          diminished as I learned that every one of my fellow trainees received
          orders for Vietnam. This unlikely series of events could not, in my
          mind, be anything but the providence of God.
