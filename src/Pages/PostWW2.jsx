            When I arrived in Germany in early July 1970, the world's attention
            was firmly focused on the war in Vietnam. At that time, the casualty
            figures exceeded 1.5 million people killed (50,000 U.S., 254,000
            South Vietnamese, 849,000 North Vietnamese military personnel, and
            400,000 North and South Vietnamese civilians).

            The conflicting world views and political ambitions of the U.S. and
            the Soviet Union, which contributed to the escalating involvement of
            the U.S. in the Vietnam War, had their genesis in post-war Germany.
            Fundamental philosophical differences regarding how people should be
            governed, at the root of the conflict in Vietnam, were earlier made
            manifest to the world in post-war Berlin.

            "(The) Cold War, Open yet restricted rivalry and hostility that
            developed after World War II between the U.S. and the Soviet Union
            and their respective allies. The U.S. and Britain, alarmed by the
            Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, feared the expansion of Soviet
            power and communism in Western Europe and elsewhere. The Soviets
            were determined to maintain control of Eastern Europe, in part to
            safeguard against a possible renewed threat from Germany. The Cold
            War (the term was first used by Bernard Baruch during a
            congressional debate in 1947) was waged mainly on political,
            economic, and propaganda fronts and had only limited recourse to
            weapons. It was at its peak in 1948–53 with the Berlin blockade and
            airlift, the formation of NATO, the victory of the communists in the
            Chinese civil war, and the Korean War. Another intense stage
            occurred in 1958–62 with the Cuban missile crisis, which resulted in
            a weapons buildup by both sides. A period of détente in the 1970s
            was followed by renewed hostility. The Cold War ended with the
            collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991."

            Immediately after Germany's unconditional surrender on May 7, 1945,
            the Soviet Union focused on exacting punishment and reparations for
            atrocities suffered during the German invasion of Russia. The Soviet
            plan included moving skilled workers and other valuable German
            assets to Soviet-controlled countries while leaving the remaining
            German people to fend for themselves with few agricultural,
            industrial, or medical resources.

            The Western Allies, led by the U.S., focused on building up the West
            German state for humanitarian, economic, and political reasons. A
            stable, self-sufficient West Germany could eventually feed itself,
            significantly reducing the money required from other nations to feed
            so many people. The Western Allies also reasoned that a strong West
            Germany would provide a buffer between the Soviet-controlled
            countries and the rest of Europe.

            These conflicting philosophies and ambitions had their focal point

            with the other Allies, and what a soldier can expect as he or she
            serves in Berlin. There are pictures of some interesting sites in
            and around Berlin like the Congress Hall (built by the U.S. in 1957
            for international exhibitions), the Kaiser-Wilhelm memorial church,
            and the Olympic Stadium, the site of the 1936 Olympic games. There
            are also pictures of soldiers in action. I am pictured on page 6 of
            this issue in my sleeping quarters playing guitar. Grand Funk
            Railroad is pictured on page 5 also playing guitars. The resemblance
            is uncanny! Since there is mention in this publication of a Johnny
            Cash concert in September 1972, this special issue must have been
            published well after I had left.
