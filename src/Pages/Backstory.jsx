            On May 1, 1960, four months before I started high school, a CIA U-2
            Spy Plane, flown by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down by the Soviet
            air defense forces while performing photographic aerial
            reconnaissance deep inside Soviet territory. This incident was a
            significant international embarrassment to the United States. It
            came at a very sensitive time in the developing Cold War between the
            United States and the Soviet Union.

            The single-seated aircraft had successfully evaded Soviet air
            defense capabilities on several previous missions. Powers had taken
            off from Peshawar, Pakistan, and crashed near Sverdlovsk after being
            hit by an S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missile. Powers parachuted
            safely and was quickly captured. Powers was convicted of espionage
            and sentenced to three years of imprisonment plus seven years of
            hard labor but was released two years later in February 1962 in a
            prisoner exchange for Soviet intelligence officer Rudolf Abel.

            On October 17, 1962, every network brought news that a U.S. U2 spy
            plane photographed evidence that as many as 32 Soviet-built
            medium-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear
            warhead to any location within a 1,600-mile radius were already in
            Cuba with more on the way. In 0response, President Kennedy
            established an Executive Committee of the National Security Council
            comprised of top officials of the U.S. Departments of Defence,
            State, the CIA, and other national security experts.

            The President received advice on the most appropriate response
            ranging from a direct attack on the missile sites to a blockade of
            the island nation. Arguing for the direct attack approach, Air Force
            Chief General Curtis LeMay stated, “They'll do nothing," in response
            to the President's question about a Soviet response to a direct
            attack. Kennedy responded: "Are you trying to tell me they'll let us
            bomb their missiles and kill a lot of Russians and then do nothing?
            If they don't do anything in Cuba they'll certainly do something in
            Berlin."

            Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara proposed that a blockade of
            Cuba would put pressure on the Soviets but give them time to
            reconsider and deescalate. It would also provide the U.S. with time
            to prepare for more aggressive action if warranted. McNamara noted
            that surgical airstrikes were not practical unless followed by an
            invasion.

            President Kennedy decided on a plan based upon McNamara's advice and
            ordered a total naval "quarantine" of Cuba, declaring that the U.S.
            would prevent any ship carrying offensive weapons from reaching
            Cuba. There was a real possibility that the U.S. Navy would forcibly
            stop and board Soviet ships and that war would ensue. Eventually,
            the two nations negotiated the total removal of missiles and the
            destruction of the launch facilities.

            On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in
            Dallas, TX. I remember being in the Ridgewood, NJ Highschool
            cafeteria when a news broadcast could suddenly be heard over the PA
            system reporting that the President had been shot. There was a
            stunned silence as we all tried to make sense of what we heard

            Over the next five years, riots fueled by racial injustice rocked
            the U.S. Riots began in Birmingham, Alabama (1963), reignited in
            Harlem in New York City (1964), spread to Watts in Los Angeles
            (1965), then to Chicago (1966). During the "long hot summer" of

            , officially the war between North and South Vietnam began in 1955
            and ended in 1975. Since North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet
            Union, China, and other communist allies and South Vietnam was
            supported by the United States, South Korea, the Philippines,
            Thailand, and other anti-communist allies, the war was seen as an
            extension of the Cold War.

            US troop involvement in Vietnam escalated from approximately 23,000
            US advisors in early 1964 to over 184,000by the end of that year.
            This dramatic increase was in response to an alleged attack on two
            US destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin by fast attack craft from North
            Vietnam. This escalation was made possible by the passing of the
            Gulf of Tonkin Resolution by the U.S. Congress on August 5, 1964. It
            authorized President Johnson to take any measures he believed were
            necessary to retaliate and to promote the maintenance of
            international peace and security in southeast Asia. This resolution
            became the legal basis for the Johnson and Nixon Administrations’
            prosecution of the Vietnam War.

            Every year onward, there was significant build-up of U.S forces,
            despite little progress. U.S Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara,
            one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts
            of victory by the end of 1966. U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied
            on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and
            destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and
            airstrikes. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale strategic bombing
            campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.

            The Tet Offensive of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these
            doctrines. With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban
            offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began
            fading. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) expanded
            following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S
            doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and
            subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over
            50,000 men. The CIA's Phoenix Program further degraded the VC's
            membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC
            insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their
            recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic
            reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of
            PAVN regular soldiers from the north.

            The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and
            first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the Easter Offensive
            of 1972.The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and
            the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself
            failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation
            difficult.

            The Paris Peace Accords of January 1973 saw all U.S forces
            withdrawn; the Case–Church Amendment, passed by the U.S Congress on
            15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement.
            The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting
            continued for two more years. Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge on
            17 April 1975 while the 1975 Spring Offensive saw the capture of
            Saigon by the PAVN on 30 April; this marked the end of the war, and
            North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.
