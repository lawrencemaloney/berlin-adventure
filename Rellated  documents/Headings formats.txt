            Unlike many typical high schools in northern New Jersey, Ridgewood high school only covered grades 10 through 12. Grades nine through
            11 were housed in two middle school buildings: the Benjamin Franklin
            school, and the George Washington school. Having attended a private
            school through eighth grade, I spent my “freshman” year of high
            school at George Washington school, about a mile from our house.
